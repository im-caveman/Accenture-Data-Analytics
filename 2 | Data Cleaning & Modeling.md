# Let's dive into the data
So, let’s have a look at what data you have to work with. The client has sent through:

   - **7 data sets** - _each data set contains different columns and values_
   - **A data model** - _this shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables._

There is a lot of information here and it’s easy to get lost in the data. So, to make sure I'm the right data to answer the business questions I followed these steps:

   * Requirements gathering
   * Data cleaning
   * Data modelling
