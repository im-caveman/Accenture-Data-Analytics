# Project Overview ðŸš€

**Client:** Social Buzz</br>
**Industry:** Social Media & Content Creation</br>
**Engagement:** 3-Month Initial Project

Social Buzz is a rapidly scaling social media platform with over 500 million monthly active users. Their unique approach focuses on anonymous user interactions and content-driven engagement, with over 100 reaction types for users to express themselves. However, their rapid growth has led to challenges in managing and analyzing their massive, unstructured data.

Accenture was brought in to help Social Buzz with three key objectives:

  1. Audit of their big data practices

  2. Recommendations for a successful IPO

  3. Analysis of content categories to identify the top 5 with the largest aggregate popularity

I was part of the team responsible for the third objective: _analyzing Social Buzzâ€™s content categories to identify the top 5 most popular categories based on user engagement._
